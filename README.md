# Non-Invasive-Choleterol-Detection
This project titled 'Design and Development of a Windkessel Model-Based Non-Invasive Cholesterol Monitoring System,' focuses on a novel approach to assessing cholesterol levels without the need for invasive procedures. Using a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, our system captures physiological signals such as pulse wave velocity and blood pressure. By integrating these signals into the Windkessel model, we estimate arterial stiffness, which correlates with cholesterol levels. The goal was to create a more accessible, quick, and painless method for cholesterol testing. The approach is designed to enhance patient convenience and enable faster screening for cardiovascular risk factors, with early tests showing promising accuracy and usability.
